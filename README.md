# Thufir Extension for Visual Studio Code

Thufir is a Visual Studio Code extension designed to help with server monitoring and management for developers. 
It aims to combine real-time server metrics visualization, integration with Prometheus, and AI-powered root cause analysis 
to provide actionable insights and efficient server management.

## Features

### 1. **Server Management**
- Add, remove, connect to, and disconnect from remote servers.
- Secure SSH-based connections.

### 2. **Metrics Collection**
- Gather key server metrics such as:
  - CPU usage
  - Memory usage
  - Disk usage
  - System uptime
  - Load averages
- Metrics are collected via shell commands executed on the server.

### 3. **Real-time Monitoring**
- View metrics updated at a configurable interval (default: 5000 milliseconds).
- Live updates every second in a user-friendly webview panel within VS Code.

### 4. **Integration with Prometheus** (this will be a future feature)
- Fetch and display metrics from Prometheus endpoints.
- Visualize long-term trends and metrics alongside real-time data.
- Simplify server performance monitoring with Prometheusâ€™s robust querying capabilities.

### 5. **AI-Powered Root Cause Analysis** (this will be a future feature)
- Leverage LLMs to analyze server metrics.
- Automatically detect anomalies and identify potential root causes.
- Suggest remediation steps to resolve issues.

### 6. **Integration with VS Code**
- Tree view for server exploration.
- Dedicated panel for detailed metrics visualization.
- Commands accessible via the command palette.

### 7. **Configuration** (this will be a future feature)
- Customizable refresh interval for server metrics.
- User-defined Prometheus configurations.
